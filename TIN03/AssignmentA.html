                        <p>Nausea is the essence of being people stuck `in the hustle and bustle of the day. People - thrown to the mercy of an alien, ruthless, dreary reality.
                            Nausea is the impossibility of love and trust, it is simply the inability of man and woman to understand each other.
                            Nausea is the very `other side of despair,' on which lies Freedom. But - what to do with this cursed freedom to a man, beset by loneliness?</p>

He didn't particularly like his drinks cold, but he knew that the drama of chiseling the ice and then pouring a drink over it looked far more impressive than how he actually liked it. It was all about image and he'd managed to perfect the image that he wanted to project.

                            Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. Ronald Aronson describes the reaction of Albert Camus, still in Algeria and working on his own first novel, L’Étranger. At the time of the novel's release, Camus was a reviewer for an Algiers left-wing daily. Camus told a friend that he "thought a lot about the book" and it was "a very close part of [himself]." In his review, Camus wrote, "the play of the toughest and most lucid mind are at the same time both lavished and squandered." Camus felt that each of the book's chapters, taken by itself, "reaches a kind of perfection in bitterness and truth." However, he also felt that the descriptive and the philosophical aspects of the novel are not balanced, that they "don't add up to a work of art: the passage from one to the other is too rapid, too unmotivated, to evoke in the reader the deep conviction that makes the art of the novel." He likewise felt that Sartre had tipped the balance too far in depicting the repugnant features of mankind "instead of placing the reasons for his despair, at least to a certain degree, if not completely, on the elements of human greatness." Still, Camus's largely positive review led to a friendship between the two authors.</p>

Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century, was born in Prague, where he spent his childhood and youth, lived in Berlin, Paris and Switzerland. R.M. called Russian culture the basis of his life perception and experience. He visited Russia twice, was acquainted with Leo Tolstoy and Repin, corresponded with Boris Pasternak and Marina Tsvetaeva. World fame for the poet brought his collections "The Book of Images," "The Book of Hours", "New Poems" and others. However, poetry and prose competed equally in the work of Rilke. The "Notes of Malthe Laurids Brygge," included in this book, is his most important prose work. Rilke anticipated the artistic discoveries of existentialist literature for more than thirty years in this bizarre novel-vitrage that describes the "everyday horror" of everyday life.</p>

                        <p>One of the most famous works of European existentialism, which literary scholars rightly compare to Albert Camus' The Outsider. Boredom corrodes the lyrical hero of Moravia's famous novel from the inside, depriving him of the will to act and to live, the ability to seriously love or hate, but it also removes him from the chaos of the world around him, helping him to avoid many mistakes and illusions. The author does not impose on us an attitude toward the character, inviting us to draw our own conclusions from what we have read. However, the moral right to "dissimilarity" with the others the writer does not notice for his character.</p>
