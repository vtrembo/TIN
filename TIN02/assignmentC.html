                <h2>Don Quixote</h2>
                <p>The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, or just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">Don Quixote</a>, 
                      is a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes. It was originally published in two parts, 
                      in 1605 and 1615. A founding work of Western literature, it is often labeled as the first modern novel and is considered 
                      one of the greatest works ever written. Don Quixote also holds the distinction of being one of the most-translated books in the world.
                      The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) from La Mancha named Alonso Quixano, who reads so many chivalric romances that 
                      he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote 
                      de la Mancha. He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's 
                      rhetorical monologues on knighthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the
                       world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story.</p>

                <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
                <p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a> is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth,
                     a place like Earth at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit,
                      but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of 
                      the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
                      The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the 
                      other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings 
                      in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest 
                      to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.</p>
